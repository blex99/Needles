2D Platformer where you play as a cactus and use the environment in creative ways.  

Q: Who made this?  
A: Cameron Schiff (Lead), Atley Sakamoto (Level Designer, 2D/ UI Artist), and Alex Chapman (Programmer, Music)  

Q: When was this game made?  
A: Spring 2020  

Q: What challenges came about when creating this?  
A: Working with a team closer than I ever had before was my biggest challenge. Usually in school projects, I do most of the work by myself. However, my other teamates were determined and hard-working, which I was not used to seeing. I had to let some of my ideas go, and allow other people to take control. More technically, the game's mechanics (sticking to walls, swinging curtains, and picking up blocks) went through many iterations before they turned out to be the way they are now.  

Q: What things inspired/ helped you to make this?  
A: Brakey's youtube tutorials helped a lot. The work my teamates put in were my main inspiration.
